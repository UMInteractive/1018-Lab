# 3D Printing
At the Lab we have an Ultimaker 3 for more information visit the [ultimaker site](https://ultimaker.com/). The ultimaker 3 is a dual nozzle printer capable of printing 2 colors or one color and a support material.

General filament nozzles are designated as AA cores. Support nozzles are designated as BB cores.

## [Materials](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/manuals/materials)

At the lab we print with:

* PLA (Poly Lactic Acid)
* PVA (polyvinyl alcohol)
 * commonly used to create water-soluble support structures

*IF you would like to print with any other material please consult with your instructor*
